 - What is Interpreter?
	An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a 	programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

 - What is the different between compiler and interpreter?

Interpreter:
	 + Translates program one statement at a time.	
	 + It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time 		is  - slower.
	 + No intermediate object code is generated, hence are memory efficient.	
	 + Continues translating the program until the first error is met, in which case it stops. 		Hence debugging is easy.	
	 + Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreters

Compiler:
	 + Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.
	 + It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time 		is comparatively faster.
	 + Generates intermediate object code which further requires linking, hence requires more 		memory.	
	 + It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program. Hence debugging 		is comparatively hard.
	 + Programming language like C, C++ use compilers.
